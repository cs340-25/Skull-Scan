We will be using the CLIP software from OpenAI
Here is the link to the instructions for installing 
[CLIP](https://github.com/openai/CLIP/tree/main)



To use this you must first make batch folders of the content you want to scan
Then you will use the Image_proccessing.py script to make binary forms of the folders
Instructions for that can be found here: [Usage_of_image_Processing.md](/Usage_of_image_processing.md)

This site has a lot of data sets to work with.
