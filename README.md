# Skull-Scan

## Heading
TBD

## Introduction

The Skull-Scan software will use a database of images and associated data to train a machine learning model. The software will use the model to make predictions about expected data relationships when given some image as input.

Our team is composed of talented, young individuals, motivated to learn about the power and beauty of machine learning. Our motivation for this project is twofold, to gain knowledge, skill, and experience with machine learning, especially in relation to image processing, and to produce a functioning image analysis tool that can assist users in making predictions or estimations based on an individual image.

Our project can be broken up into several steps. We already have a dataset to work with, but we need to parse out the data that will be useful for our purposes. We will also need to pull that data from the database and format it to work efficiently for training the model. This may include cropping images to exclude extraneous information. We will likely need more data from outside our current dataset, so we may need to write software to find and collect images and data or databases from the internet. Once we get all the data we need to work with, we will start training our data model. We will use the data model to make multiple data predictions with reasonable accuracy. This software should be modular enough to function with different datasets and varying goals for the data. It should be reusable and intuitive to work with.

Specifically, we are interested in using this software to make estimations about deceased individuals, such as age at death, sex, stage of decomposition, what their face might have looked like before death, and potentially match an image of a skull to that of an undecomposed face. We will attempt to do this based on an image of their head at an advanced stage of decomposition.

An alternative example of how this software might be used could be analysing an image of an analogue clock and audibly announcing the time indicated by the clock, or determining how many clocks are in a photo and what times they indicate. 


## Customer Value

Our software will provide tremendous customer value. Our forensic customers need to identify bodies and close investigations. With this software they will be able to make educated guesses about the identity of a victim of murder. Our anthropologist customers will use our software to research ancient civilizations and uncover the secrets of our past. The blind will be able to know what time a clock says.

Our solution will deliver accurate, state of the art predictions and estimations based on patterns and data. It will give our customers what they need most when they need it most.

The success of our endeavor will be measured by the accuracy and breadth of our predictions. As well as the modularity and multipurpose potential of our software.


## Proposed Solution & Technology

* System:
  * Our software will use AI to help process the data faster
  * The main system would be comprised of the LLM for image processing, the database for storage and quick retrieval, and the framework to ensure all components work together
  * The minimal system would have to be able to get images, and basic information from the image
  * We will test the system incrementally building it in parts that can be useful, even if not fully complete
    
* Tools: 
  * We plan on building our project using Python for as much as possible
  * We will also be using an LLM such as Llama or similar to assist in the lookup and retrieval of information
    

## Team
* Skills:
  * Has anyone on the team built something like this before? 
  * Are the tools known or new to the team?
    
* Roles:
  * What are the roles of the team members? 
  * Will the roles be fixed or rotating?
