## Heading
Project Name - Skull-Scan 

Team Name - The Boneheads

Team Members - Mylon Jones, Ryan Trenner, Scott Gibson

## Introduction

### The Project:
The Skull-Scan software uses a machine learning model trained on images from the BodyFarm database. It is trained to classify an input image of a head, and estimate the level of decay of the subject in the image. The software has a user friendly web interface that is simple and easy to use.

### The Motivation:
The motivation for this project is to create a tool that might be useful for administrators sorting unlabeled images at the BodyFarm. This project could help database administrators by estimating the stage of decay, thus allowing the to use the data even if they do not know the exact details of when the picture was taken. Another point of motivation behind this project was potential utility for forensic investigation. This project could be a proof of concept for the use of AI image classification for guessing the time of death.

### The Approach:
The approach taken in this project starts with using an existing pre-trained model and fine-tuning it using images of heads at different stages of decay from the BodyFarm database, then using the fine-tuned model to classify any uploaded skull image into one of the stages of decay.

## Team

### Participation:
While at first member activity was rather weak and participation was intermittent, by the end of the project all team members were on board and fully active.

### Role Changes:
Member roles changed throughout the development of the project just like the goals and deliverables of the project changed. The team members had to take on and swap out roles to accommodate for the changes in project trajectory.

  * Ryan Trenner: User Interface, Scripting, Research
  * Mylon Jones: Management, Research, Proof of Concept
  * Scott Gibson: Testing, Research, Debugging
